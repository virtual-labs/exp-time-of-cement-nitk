#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :   <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects, which develops
intuition, and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

Consistency in which the needle penetrates to a point 5 to 7mm from the top of mould <br>C. Consistency in which the needle penetrates to a point 25mm from the bottom of mould <br>D. None of the above <br><br> Q2) IS Standard for determination of consistency of standard cement paste is <br>A. <u>IS 4031 (Part 4): 1988</u> <br>B.  IS 4031 (Part 3): 1988 <br>C. IS 4031 (Part 2): 1988 <br>D.  IS 4031 (Part 1): 1988 |
2.| Student will be able to state the difference between Initial setting time and Final setting time of cement | Click on the button to display the difference between Initial setting time and Final setting time of cement | Q1) Initial setting time of cement is the <br>A. Time elapsed between water is added to the cement to the time that the paste starts losing its plasticity <br> B. Time elapsed between water is added to the cement to the time that the paste completely lost its plasticity <br>C. Time elapsed between the paste starts losing plasticity to the tome the paste completely lost its plasticity <br>D. None of the above |
3.| Student will be able to analyse the Standard consistency of cement | Enter the values in the Input text box provided and check the result | Q1) The standard consistency test helps to determine the _____ for other tests. <br>A. Cement content <br> B. Slump <br> C. <u>Water content</u> <br> D. Setting time |
4.| Student will be able to analyse the Initial setting time of cement | Enter the values in the Input text box provided and check the result | Q1) The initial setting time of cement is recorded when <br>A. The needle penetrates the paste to a depth 5-7 mm from the top <br> B. The needle penetrates the paste to a depth 33 to 35mm from the top <br> C. The needle penetrates the paste to a depth 33 to 35mm from the bottom <br> D. All are wrong |
5.| Student will be able to evaluate the effect of gauging time on cement paste | Click on the text box provided and evaluate the effect of gauging time on cement paste | Q1) Select the correct one! <br> The gauging time of the paste should not be <br>1. Less than 5 minutes <br>2. More than 5 minutes <br>3. Less than 3 minutes <br>A. only 2 <br> B. <u>2 and 3</u> <br> C. 1 and 2 <br> D. only 3 |

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| See the displayed objectives and apparatus used then select either Standard Consistency or Initial Setting Time of cement, click on next button | Display objective and apparatus used | Display calculate the target strength for mix proportioning | Recall the experiment
2.| Understand the procedure then click ON button, click on the pan and tare the weighing machine to set it to zero then click on next button | Display take cement in a pan and measure 300gram of cement using the weighing balance | To provide basic environment to start the experiment
3.|  Obtain the required water to be added, click on the measuring jar then click on the trowel in order to mix the cement paste, click on next button | Display take about 26% water by weight of dry cement and mix it thoroughly with the cement. The gauging time should not be more than 3 to 5 minutes | To obtain the uniformity in mix
4.| Click on the trowel to fill the cement paste to the Vicat mould, click on next button to proceed | Display fill the Vicat mould resting upon non-porous plate | To fill the Vicat mould resting upon non-porous plate
5.| Click on the mould to place it below the test setup, then click on the screw beside the plunger in order to place the plunger on the top surface of the mould, click on next button | Display fix the 1mm<sup>2</sup> Vicat plunger and the place the mould under the test setup | To find the initial reading
6.| Click on the screw above the plunger to release it quickly, click on next button | Display lower the plunger to touch the surface of the mould and release it quickly to sink into the paste | To find the final reading
7.| Click on the tamping rod to remove the extra concrete then click on next button | Display remove extra concrete with the trowel and tamping rod | To level the top surface of the cone
8.| Fill the table according to the observation obtained | Display observation | To check for the calculated data whether it is correct or not
9.| Carry out the experiment for 4 trials | Display the same process for different trials | To obtain the results
